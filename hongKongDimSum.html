            <h2>Hong Kong Dim Sum</h2>
            <p>
            A famous Hong Kong Dim Sum place with a long history. Where the locals go.
            </p>
            <p>
            Hong Kong Dim Sum tastes much different than westernized Dim Sum...meaning that none of us really enjoyed it!
            </p>
            <p>
            This is where I was also introduced to the ritual of having to clean your own utensils before eating. <br />
            It's an established part of the process...you are given a special bowl which you fill with hot soup that you douse your utensils in for cleaning purposes.  <br />
            Before the food is served, the dirty bowl is taken away as you sip fresh tea (from the same bowl as the tea you just used to clean with!)
            </p>
            <p>
            This cleaning ritual seems to be limited to just the province that Hong Kong and Shenzhen are located in.
